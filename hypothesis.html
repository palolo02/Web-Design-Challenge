                    <h3>1. Close-relationships Incidents are deadlier than those in which the victim(s) is/are unknown (like robberies).</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>Familiar incidents are commoly found in any society, like robberies. However, which one tends to be more letal? This statement came to this list after exploring some data and realizing that not only mass shootings or robbery occur in the US, but also sentimental tragedies are present in close relationships. Since these unfortunate events happen frequently, we suggest that those moments in which the suspect knows the victim(s) and perpetrate crimes result in lethal results in contrast with those in which there is only a robbery, for example.</p>

                    <h3>2. Southern states (near Mexico) present higher levels of deaths</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>Drug issues in states near the border from Mexico is a familiar problem where even the current administration in USA has established several approaches to effectively limit this consumption with no successful results. Therefore, we think that there might be a possible correlation between the number of deaths and the location.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h2>Why Pittsburgh?</h2>
                    <p>It turns out that Pennsylvania is one of the states with an important decrease in the number of violent incidents per year. There must be some social, economical and even educational factor that have contributed to reach low levels in those indicators. Along with information we found about Pittsburg, a city within Pennsylvania, we think that we can explain the reason why this has happened.</p>

                    <h3>1. Income vs Crime</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>As a society or individual, we assume based on several research that Income Factor plays an important role in increasing Crime levels. We know that Poverty, Unemployment and other Economic factor like these affect the person or family’s Income. These factors have been mentioned by studies as the most frequent reason to commit a Crime. Our challenge will be to find how strong is the relationship between Income factor and Crime Level and measure it's impact in our Society.</p>

                    <h3>2. Education vs Crime</h3>
                    <br />
                    <p>Education got many benefits for an individual or a society. Some studies have shown that Education reduce poverty, so in consequence we assume that it could increase the Income and reduce Crime levels. Researches in US have stablished that by increasing the high school graduation rate as a result the Crime levels have decreased. We want to know how strong is the relationship between Education factor and Crime Level, and measure it’s impact against crime rate over a period of time.
