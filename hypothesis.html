                        However, which one tends to be more letal? This statement came to this list after 
                        exploring some data and realizing that not only mass shootings or robbery occur in the US, 
                        but also sentimental tragedies are present in close relationships. Since these unfortunate 
                        events happen frequently, we suggest that those moments in which the suspect knows the victim(s) 
                        and perpetrate crimes result in lethal results in contrast with those in which there is only a 
                        robbery, for example.</p>

                    <p>Drug issues in states near the border from Mexico is a familiar problem where 
                        even the current administration in USA has established several approaches to 
                        effectively limit this consumption with no successful results. Therefore, we 
                        think that there might be a possible correlation between the number of deaths 
                        and the location.</p>

                    <p>It turns out that Pennsylvania is one of the states with an important 
                        decrease in the number of violent incidents per year. There must be some social, 
                        economical and even educational factor that has contributed to reach low levels 
                        in those indicators. Along with information we found about Pittsburg, a city 
                        within Pennsylvania, we think that we can explain the reason why this has happened.</p>

                    <p>As a society or individual, we assume based on several research that Income 
                        Factor plays an important role in increasing Crime levels. We know that Poverty, 
                        Unemployment and other Economic factor like these affect the person or familyâ€™s 
                        Income. These factors have been mentioned by studies as the most frequent reason 
                        to commit a Crime. Our challenge will be to find how strong is the relationship 
                        between Income factor and Crime Level and measure it's impact in our Society.</p>

                    <p>Education got many benefits for an individual or a society. Some studies have 
                        shown that Education reduce poverty, so in consequence we assume that it could 
                        increase the Income and reduce Crime levels. Researches in US have stablished 
                        that by increasing the high school graduation rate as a result the Crime levels 
                        have decreased. We want to know how strong is the relationship between Education 
                        factor and Crime Level, and measure itâ€™s impact against crime rate over a period 
                        of time.</p>
