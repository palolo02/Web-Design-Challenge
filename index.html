            <p>As we live in a society constantly exposed to violence from several sources of information, 
              social media has played a crucial role in not only sharing violent situations instantaneously, 
              but also in providing more data to get a better understanding of when, how and why those complex 
              problems occured in the past. In US, for instance, incidents involving guns have rapidly increased 
              over the last 5 years. However, we barely know some of the social factors that contribute to these 
              interesting numbers and now we have the possibility to dig further into these conditions and have a 
              fresh perspective that may explain some unhiden patterns that lead to intriguing steps in preventing 
              them to happen more often.

            <p>In addition, researches have considered and measured Social and Economic factors like income, 
              health, education, family live, housing, progress on industrialization, urbanization, etc. 
              One study showed that those variables are crucial factors that lead a person to commit a crime. 
              While some researches have said that these variables influence rates of crime, others think that 
              this result is not clear. In order to better understand this issue, we are going to analyze the 
              relationship among some of them and find out their impact in crime levels in other cities in the US.

            <p>At the same time, our data analysis will focus on in Pittsburgh PA. From our standpoint, it seems 
              interesting how, from 2014 and 2015, this city radically modified its crime rates. We are going to 
              analyze its levels and rates in population, education, income, house contract, and house value to 
              lead to some conclusions, insights, patterns or trends to explain why this social phenomenon ocurred.
