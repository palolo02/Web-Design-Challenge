                    <p>As every dataset hides a lot of ways to tell what is happening, the gun data file is no exception. 
                        From the beginning we observed that there are general patterns were we can start making assumptions 
                        of what is happening, how the data is related to itself, how we can see it from another perspective 
                        and lastly, how we can learn from it.
                        Let's have a look at what we have
