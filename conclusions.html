                    <p>Violence will always be part of any community. It can be found in different types, but maybe the reason behind why people act in such way can lead us understand why there are more victims in close-relationship issues. This reasoning supports our original statement in which, for example, a conflict within a family can lead to drastic measures as part of a solution. In contrast, a robbery most of the times remains in shuch an action to get you away from your stuff and in a few times it will be an excuse to kill.

                    <p>Based on the correlation result between Income and Crime, we can say that there is an inverse relationship between these two variables and Crime. It means when the % Income Increases or % Graduates increases our % Offence per person Decreases (meaning there is a definite, consequential relationship between these two variables). However, our Income and Graduates P- value are 0.17 and 0.82 respectively. It means Our p-value are greater than 0.05 significance level, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis, it indicates that our samples did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the effect exists. However, at the same time, that lack of evidence as we said it doesnâ€™t prove that the effect does not exist. In addition to that we observed that the size or the sample plays a big role to test a hypothesis, here we got a small data sample to work with. In order understand this phenomenon we can perform the same exercise using a large amount of data (and granular) that allow us to reject or fail to reject this hypothesis properly.
