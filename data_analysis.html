                <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
                <p>As every dataset hides a lot of ways to tell what is happening, the gun data file is 
                  no exception. From the beginning we observed that there are general patterns were we 
                  can start making assumptions of what is happening, how the data is related to itself, 
                  how we can see it from another perspective and lastly, how we can learn from it.
                  Let's have a look at what we have
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div>
              <div class="row">
                  <div class="col">
                    <h2>Correlation between the # of licenses and gun crimes</h2>
                  </div>

                    </div>
                      <p>On this graph we can appreciate that the countries with the largest number of licenses are not 
                        necessarily the most violent. This is a consequence of stronger gun regulation laws like in New York 
                        and California that also are the most populated states.
                      </p>
                      <p>After considering the deadliest type of incidents, we wanted to look at the same relationshp but 
                          this time by only cosidering the numer of injured we can find in those moments. Unsurprisingly, 
                          we noticed a bigger distribution in armed robberies. A reason that may explain this behavior 
                          could be the purpose. According to some information, during robberies, perpetrators only want 
                          to get away this other's belongins, not actually kille them (unless they do not have any other option), 
                          which is contrary to what we can find in close relationships.

                      <p>In order to answer this question, we need to focus on the key types of crime that 
                        ocurr more often. Once we stablish that group, we then compare the distribution of 
                        each one incidents according to the number of their victims they got (% lethality) 
                        and plot their behaviour. If we concentrate in the first three categories (tallest 
                        curves), we see that those are actually close-relationships, whereas the shortest 
                        correspond to categories in which the victims could potentially not know the 
                        perpetrator. We are assumming that in a robbery, typically the victm is randomly 
                        chosen, otherwise it will be more likely that they end up in jail. The take-away 
                        from this plot is that those conflicts that involve close-ones are more likely to 
                        have more victims.

                      <p>Here, we observe where those incidents happened in the US. At first sight, 
                        there is concentration of violence in south east states, a zone that is not 
                        really close to mexican border. As we are thinking that souternwest states 
                        have more levels of violence, let's split the incidents in those fours cuadrants 
                        and see the results.

                  </div>
                  <p>The results show something different from what we expected. According to the graph, 
                    the deadliest zone in three years has been southeast and in second place comes northeast. 
                    Referring to our hypothesis, we can say that the closer we get to Mexico does not 
                    imply a hiher level of deaths in those states. At this point, we can remember that 
                    states such as District of Columbia or Lussiana are among the top 5 more violent 
                    states and they are situated in the southeast cuadrant, making more sense of the data.
